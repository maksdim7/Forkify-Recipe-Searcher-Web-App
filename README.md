# 🍴 Forkify

🚀 Live Demo: TODO link

Forkify is a modern recipe web application that allows users to search for recipes, explore ingredients, and access step-by-step cooking instructions. The app also enables users to upload their own recipes, bookmark their favorites, and store them locally for future access.

📌 Overview
Forkify provides an intuitive and dynamic interface for discovering and managing recipes. It integrates external recipe data through asynchronous API calls and allows users to interact with the application in a seamless and responsive way.

This project was built using plain JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, without any frontend frameworks, focusing on core JavaScript concepts and modern development practices.

✨ Features
🔍 Search Recipes – Search through a wide collection of recipes using keywords.
🥕 View Ingredients – See all required ingredients for any selected recipe.
👨‍🍳 Cooking Instructions – Follow the external link provided to prepare your chosen dish.
➕ Add Your Own Recipes – Upload custom recipes to the application.
⭐ User Recipe Indicator – Recipes added by you are marked with a special icon.
🔖 Bookmark Recipes – Save favorite recipes to local storage.
💾 Persistent Storage – Bookmarked recipes remain saved using localStorage.

🛠️ Technologies Used
HTML5
CSS3
JavaScript (ES6+)
JavaScript Modules (import / export)
Asynchronous JavaScript (async/await, AJAX calls, API integration)
MVC Architecture
Git & Version Control
Parcel (Module Bundler)
Deployment (Production/Distribution Build)

🧠 Architecture & Concepts Learned
MVC Architecture
The application follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern:
Model – Handles application state and API communication.
View – Responsible for rendering UI components.
Controller – Connects the Model and View, managing application logic and event handling.

Implementing MVC helped structure the project in a clean, maintainable, and scalable way.

Modern JavaScript Features
During the development of Forkify, I worked with:
ES6 Modules (import / export)
Async/Await for handling asynchronous operations
AJAX calls for fetching data from an external recipe API
State management
Local storage handling
Event delegation
Object-Oriented and modular code structure

📦 Bundling & Deployment
The project was bundled using Parcel, which optimized and prepared the application for production.
A distribution build was generated and deployed to the internet, ensuring:
Optimized assets
Minified JavaScript and CSS
Improved performance

🎯 What I Learned
Through building Forkify, I gained hands-on experience with:
Structuring applications using MVC
Writing clean and modular JavaScript
Handling asynchronous data flows
Managing application state
Version control using Git
Preparing production-ready builds
Deploying a web application

📚 Course Credit
This project is part of the JavaScript course by Jonas Schmedtmann, where I applied and practiced advanced JavaScript concepts in a real-world project environment.

📷 Future Improvements
Option to delete a recipe
Pagination refinements
Enhanced form validation
Additional filtering options
